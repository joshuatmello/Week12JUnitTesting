# Week12JUnitTesting

This week practices JUnit testing. In the TestDemo.java file I created three methods (addPositive, getRandomInt, and randomNumberSquared) to obtain a random number and then square it's value, in addition to adding two positive numbers together. 
The TestDemoTest.java file tests these methods.
